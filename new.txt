        "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has officially agreed to purchase server builder ZT Systems in a cash and stock deal valued at $4.9 billion. The Futurum Group chief market strategist Cory Johnson joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the implications of this acquisition for AMD's future. Johnson notes that this deal positions AMD as \"a more complete offering\" among its competitors, particularly Nvidia (NVDA). He points out that Nvidia's systems are \"complete,\" with the company managing operations well beyond just chip sales. The ZT acquisition \"gives AMD something closer\" to achieving this level of control, though Johnson acknowledges there's still a considerable gap to close. A key benefit of the acquisition, according to Johnson, is the influx of engineering talent. This will give AMD an edge in designing complete systems. \"This looks to be like a really great deal for AMD,\" Johnson tells Yahoo Finance. He emphasizes AMD's position as \"the number two player in this space,\" noting that they are \"trying to catch up to what Nvidia's been doing.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

The average stock in the Argus Universe of Coverage declined 2.4% during the quarter, while the median stock dropped 3.0%.  The average BUY-rated stock declined 0.7%, while the average HOLD-rated stock gained 6.7%.  Will the rally broaden in 2H24, or will investors keep focusing on Tech and Communications groups?  Will small-caps pick up their pace (the Russell 2000 was up 1.8% in 1H24), or is the current bull market rally due for a break, with some profit-taking coming into play?  Given declining interest rates, we expect growth stocks to continue to carry the bull market, while the risk of recession puts a premium on clean balance sheets, which are also more prevalent among large-caps. Investors seeking value are encouraged to focus on dividends and look for yields in the 3-4% range.
